### Implementing File Upload on the Server Application
#### Objective:
Implement a server-side file upload system using Node.js and Express that can properly receive,
validate, store, and serve files uploaded from the React/Next.js frontend. You will learn how to
handle multipart form data on the server, implement file type validation, size limitations, and
proper error handling while creating a secure and efficient file storage system.
By connecting the frontend drag-and-drop interface with the backend implementation, you will
gain a comprehensive understanding of the complete file upload flow from client to server in
modern web applications
