# Reflection

Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of designing and implementing RESTful APIs. I learned how to structure endpoints effectively, ensuring they follow best practices for URI design and HTTP methods. Working with tools like Prisma and Supabase has enhanced my ability to manage databases and integrate file storage solutions seamlessly.

I also explored the importance of middleware in Express.js, such as authentication, file uploads, and error handling, which are crucial for building secure and scalable applications. Implementing features like pagination, cursor-based queries, and relationships between models helped me understand how to handle complex queries efficiently.

Additionally, I realized the significance of environment variables for managing sensitive data securely and the importance of maintaining a clean and organized project structure. Debugging and resolving issues, such as compatibility problems with dependencies, taught me the value of troubleshooting and adapting to challenges during development.

Overall, this project has strengthened my skills in backend development, database management, and API design, preparing me for more advanced projects in the future.
