## Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied

- **RESTful API Design**: Structured endpoints using best practices for URI design and HTTP methods.
- **Prisma ORM & Supabase**: Utilized Prisma for database management and Supabase for cloud-based storage and authentication.
- **Middleware in Express.js**: Implemented middleware for authentication, file uploads, error handling, and validation.
- **Pagination & Data Relationships**: Added pagination and managed relationships between models for efficient data handling.
- **Environment Variables**: Used `.env` files to securely manage sensitive configuration data.

### What I Learned

Working on this project gave me a deeper understanding of designing and building efficient, maintainable RESTful APIs. I learned the importance of logical endpoint structure, proper HTTP method usage, and clear URI design. Integrating Prisma and Supabase showed me how modern tools can simplify database and storage management.

I also realized the critical role of middleware in Express.js for handling authentication, file uploads, and errors, which are essential for building secure and scalable applications. Implementing pagination and managing model relationships provided practical experience in optimizing complex queries and improving performance.

Managing environment variables taught me about securing sensitive information and keeping configuration flexible. Debugging and resolving issues improved my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Overall, this project reinforced the importance of clean code, documentation, and best practices in backend development.

### Challenges Faced

One challenge was configuring and integrating both Prisma and Supabase, especially when dealing with authentication and storage. I overcame this by carefully reading documentation and testing different configurations.

Another challenge was implementing efficient pagination for large datasets. I researched various strategies and chose the one that best fit the projectâ€™s needs.
