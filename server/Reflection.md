# Reflection

## What I Understand from This

From working on this project, I now have a clearer understanding of how to design and build RESTful APIs that are both efficient and maintainable. I learned the importance of structuring endpoints logically and following best practices for HTTP methods and URI design. Using tools like Prisma and Supabase helped me see how modern backend frameworks and cloud services can simplify database management and file storage integration.

I also realized how crucial middleware is in Express.js for handling authentication, file uploads, and errors, which are all essential for building secure and scalable applications. Implementing features such as pagination and managing relationships between models gave me practical experience in handling complex data queries and optimizing performance.

Managing environment variables taught me about securing sensitive information and keeping configuration flexible. Debugging and resolving issues improved my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience with backend development, reinforced the importance of clean code and documentation, and prepared me for more advanced backend projects in the future.
